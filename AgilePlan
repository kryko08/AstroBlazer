## Agile Plan Overview
__Project Name: AstroBlazer Game__

__Sprints Duration: 1 weeks each__

__Total Sprints: 4 (adjust as needed)__

### Sprint 1: Core Mechanics and Player Interaction Goals:

__Implement player and camera movement
Develop basic shooting functionality
Create initial asteroid behavior__
Tasks:

_Player Movement:_
Implement WASD movement
Add acceleration and deceleration mechanics

_Camera Movement:_
Make the camera move on its own, it is the players job to stay on the screen.

_Shooting Functionality_:
Create a shooting mechanism
Implement bullet behavior and collision detection

_Asteroids:_
Design basic asteroid movement
Implement asteroid collision with bullets

### Sprint 2: Game Structure and User Interface
Goals:

__Develop main menu and HUD
Implement border checking
Add sounds for basic interactions__

_Main Menu:_
Create buttons, labels, etc.
Scene loading

_HUD:_
Display score, time outside screen

_Border Checking:_
Implement logic to allow player to move outside
the camera screen for limited time only

_Sounds:_
Add background music and sound effects for shooting and collisions

### Sprint 3: Power-Ups and Asteroids Spawner
Goals:

__Add power-ups and their effects,
implement gun swapping__
Tasks:

_Power-Ups:_
Design power-ups (e.g., faster shooting, shield)
Implement power-up effects and spawning logic

_Asteroids:_
Implement spawning

_Shooting Mechanics:_
Refine bullet behavior (e.g., speed, types)
Implement shooting power-ups interaction

### Sprint 4: Final Touches and Polishing
Goals:

__Implement game over screen and final HUD updates
Add final sounds and polish__

_Game Over Screen:_
Design game over UI
Implement retry and quit options

_Final HUD Updates:_
Ensure all HUD elements are working correctly
Add any missing UI elements

_Sounds:_
Finalize all game sounds and background music
Implement any additional sound effects

_Polishing:_
Conduct thorough playtesting
Fix bugs and optimize performance
